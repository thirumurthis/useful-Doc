Junit

Test Fixture:
      Test Fixture are context for running Test cases. 
      This typically includes, the resources/object available for testing the test cases.
      Also availability of those resources, referred as 
            setup - allocation
            teardown - deallocation
  
  Setup: This is achived using @Before annotation of junit. This is used for initializing objects like creating database connection before executing the test case
  Teardown: This is achived using @After annotation of junit. This is used to release the resources back. 
            Key point to note is, @After annoation executes even in case of exception or assertion failure.
